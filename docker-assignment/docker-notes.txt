# build image first, then run container

# to build the image
docker build -t image_name

# to build containers (--rm for remove after, but don't have to do that)
docker run --rm container_name image_name

# workflow for container management:
#   1. Stop container
#   2. Delete container
#   3. Delete image
# remember containers depend on images

# to view containers (-a for all containers)
docker ps -a
# to remove containers (-f to force stop if container is running)
docker rm -f container_name

# to see images
docker images
# to remove images
docker rmi image_name

# See run.sh for script on building containers
# remember to change permissions chmod +x run.sh

# WSL and VSCode with Docker HAS ISSUES and I'm exhausted. Nothing is working.
docker build --tag image_name /location/of/image
# add image attribute to devcontainer "image": "image_name"
# activate devcontainer CLI tho I forget how, somehow through uh VSCode
devcontainer up --workspace-folder /path/to/working/directory  # start a dev container
# use the run.sh template

# Open bash terminal:
# docker exec -it <container name or id> bash
