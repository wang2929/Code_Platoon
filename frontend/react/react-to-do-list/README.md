# To Do List

Part 1: Create a `To Do list` with an HTML template that will display an unordered list, a header, and tasks. You are not limited in tags so ensure to be creative and have fun in order to get familiarized with HTML.

Part 2: Add style for visual appeal and create a method that allows users to complete a task (i.e. cross out the task, create a checkmark for a task)
