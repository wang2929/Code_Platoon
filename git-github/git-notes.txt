# Master -> Main change
Change default branch setting: git config --global init.defaultBranch main
Rename branch: git branch -m name

# All about git
{ref} - anything git can resolve into a commit. Possible refs: branch_name, commit_id, rel_ref, tag_name
Create branch_name: git branch branch_name {ref!optional}
Reassign branch_name to a commit_id (not allowed on current branch): git branch -f branch_name {ref}
Change to branch_name or commit_id: git checkout {ref}
Create and change to branch_name: git checkout -b branch_name
Merge current branch with branch_name: git merge branch_name
Rebasing copies and pastes a commit to clean up the commit tree: git rebase {ref}
    Rebase copies and pastes from {ref} to the current commit
    -i interactive flag to allow to drop and re-order commits along a branch
Relative refs (rel_ref): move upwards one commit: ^, vs move upwards n commits: ~n
    Use this to replace branch_name or commit_id with a commit relative to current
    Can specify ^num if there's multiple parents (first parent is oldest parent, smallest hash)
    Can string together ^ and ~ e.g. main~2^3~2 goes back 2, 3rd parent, then back 2 again
Use reset or revert to undo a commit
    for local branches: git reset {ref}; vs for remote branches: git revert {ref}
Copy a series of commits to below the current location: git cherry-pick [list of {ref}s]
Tags for marking commits; anchor certain parts of the work process: git tag tag_name {ref}
    You cannot add commits off of tagged commits
How far {ref} currently is from closest anchor: git describe {ref}
    Format: tag - numCommits - g<hash> (hash of {ref})

# All about git and cloud (Github)
Use clone to make a local copy of a remote repository: git clone <remote_git_repo>
Remote branches are for the state of the remote repo
    Remote branches are on the local repository, not remote repository
    Default main remote name is origin
Fetch (git fetch) does two things: downloads commits in remote but not local and updates remote branch's commit location
    Does NOT change any local files; only downloads info
    Basically creates a branch with the remote changes
Pull (git pull) does two things: fetches and merges
Push (git push) uploads your local changes to remote repository
    git.default defines default behavior
    Otherwise git push remote_ref local_ref -> upload commits on local ref to remote ref
        local_ref can be a range of commits source:destination
Diverging work: local repo doesn't have commits in the remote repo
    Can fetch, rebase origin, and then push
    Can fetch, merge origin, and then push
    Can use git pull --rebase for fetch and merge/rebase

# Github process
1. create repo in Github
2. git remote add origin git_url
3. git push -u origin main

to copy a repo from Github: git clone git_url
(then I just delete .git rm -rf .git)
