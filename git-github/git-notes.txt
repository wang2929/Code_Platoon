# Master -> Main change
Change default branch setting: git config --global init.defaultBranch main
Rename branch: git branch -m name

# All about git
Create branch_name: git branch branch_name
Reassign branch_name to a commit_id (not allowed on current branch): git branch -f branch_name {commit_id | rel_ref}
Change to branch_name or commit_id: git checkout {branch_name | commit_id | rel_ref}
Create and change to branch_name: git checkout -b branch_name
Merge current branch with branch_name: git merge branch_name
Rebasing copies and pastes a commit to clean up the commit tree: git rebase {branch_name | commit_id | rel_ref}
Relative refs (rel_ref): move upwards one commit: ^, vs move upwards n commits: ~n
    Use this to replace branch_name or commit_id with a commit relative to current
Use reset or revert to undo a commit
    for local branches: git reset {branch_name | commit_id | rel_ref}; vs for remote branches: git revert
Copy a series of commits to below the current location: git cherry-pick

# Github process
1. create repo in Github
2. git remote add origin git_url
3. git push -u origin main

to copy a repo from Github: git clone git_url
(then I just delete .git rm -rf .git)
