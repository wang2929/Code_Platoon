# What's in this repo
This contains different files that I wrote while being a TA at Code Platoon's Full Stack class. The stack is Javascript and Python. This repo experiments heavily with containerization.

## docker-assignment
This folder focuses on setting up simple Dockerfile types and using a shell script to automatically build images and run containers.

## git-github
This folder is largely useless here, but was used as scratch to practice simple git and Github commands.

## python-js
This folder contains some entry-level Python and Javascript exercises. There is also a Dockerfile for a Python and Javascript environment respectively as well as a run.sh script to automatically run each exercise in a container.

The tdd folders covers test-driven development, introducing pytest and jest for automated testing.

## intro-to-oop
This folder contains classes and methods as an example for how object-oriented programming works. All in Python because I'm used to Python. Not here to debate whether Javascript is object-oriented or not.

Some of the class exercises include class attributes, class methods, inheritance, and polymorphism.
