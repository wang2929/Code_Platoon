# What's in this repo
This contains different files that I wrote while being a TA at Code Platoon's Full Stack class. The stack is Javascript and Python. This repo experiments heavily with containerization.

## docker-assignment
This folder focuses on setting up simple Dockerfile types and using a shell script to automatically build images and run containers.

## git-github
This folder is largely useless here, but was used as scratch to practice simple git and Github commands.

## python-js
This folder contains some beginner Python and Javascript exercises. There is also a Dockerfile for a Python and Javascript environment respectively as well as a run.sh script to automatically run each exercise in a container.
